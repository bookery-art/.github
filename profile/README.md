## About Bookery

Bookery was created as a response to the audits and content guideline updates conducted by Itch.io at the end of July. Indie book authors, and specially queer authors, have been targetted and had their books delisted and deleted due to censorship. It inspired me, Jun, to build a platform where indie authors and readers could connect, dedicated to books and book publihsing resources, that was easy to use and represented the values of the community.
